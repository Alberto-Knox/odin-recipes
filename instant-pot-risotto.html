        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot) 
            and select Saute function. Heat oil; add mushrooms, rice, and shallot, 
            allowing the shallot and mushrooms to saute and the rice to toast just slightly, 
            about 5 minutes. Turn off the Saute function. Stir in broth and wine.
             Close and lock the lid. </p>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 23 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build. </p>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions for 12 minutes. Release any remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. </p>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p> Season with salt and pepper. Stir and serve immediately.</p>
